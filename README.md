## üìä Data Structure

Instructor data is stored directly in the `index.html` file within a JavaScript array named `citiesData`. To add or modify data, edit this array. Each city object follows this structure:

```javascript
{
    lat: -6.9175,
    lon: 107.6191,
    city: 'Bandung',
    count: 2,
    instructors: [
        { name: 'Rahmat Pradana', skill: 'English for Business' },
        { name: 'Arfian Mauliddan', skill: 'Figma' }
    ]
}
